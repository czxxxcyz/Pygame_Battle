# Pygame_Battle
A pygame battle game made by a high school student of NSFZ（南师附中学生搞出来的小游戏）

## Background（背景）
> Gun gun long river goes to east, the waves wash away all heroes.  
> Yes or no, success or failure, turn your head and it's gone.  
> The green montain is still here, how many times shone by the dusk sun.  
> With white hair I fish on the river, regularly seeing moon and spring wind.  
> Using some cheap wine to celebrate unity.  
> Discussing the events through history with laughter.  

> 滚滚长江东逝水，浪花淘尽英雄。  
> 是非成败转头空。  
> 青山依旧在，几度夕阳红。  
> 白发渔樵江渚上，惯看秋月春风。  
> 一壶浊酒喜相逢。  
> 古今多少事，都付笑谈中。
  
That was a day of many years ago(maybe not that many). I wasn't at NSFZ but at NFLS. It was a lovely day of junior 3 and some students are playing 24 points.
Some of the pairs are really hard and none of us can word them out. A OIer used technology and solved the problem very quickly. Very quickly indeed.  
那是很久很久之前的事情了（也没那么长）。我还没来NSFZ，还在NFLS。那是初三的美好的一日，有一些同学在玩24点。
有一些组合非常困难以至于我们并没有人会做。但是当时一名信息竞赛选手开科技很快解决了问题。很快啊。

He first printed this fantastic poem in his program. So today as I started my program, I decided to use this poem as well.  
他首先在程序里输出了这首优美的诗句。所以今天我创建了自己的项目时，我决定也使用这优美的诗。
